(3) The Probation period runs for 6 months. During this time, you will be trained and be part of our team. Should you notice during this time that the position does not suit you, or should we notice that our expectations are not being met, both parties have the right to terminate the employment relationship in writing in accordance with §622 Paragraph 3 BGB (German Civil Code), subject to a two-week to the end of a calendar month period of notice.

(4) If it is necessary, we reserve the right, within the bounds of reasonable discretion, to assign you to another reasonable activity that corresponds to your previous experience. In this case, your remuneration will not change.

## § 2 Working time and place of work
(1) Your regular weekly working time will be 40 hours excluding breaks.

(2) The distribution of working time over the working days and the beginning and end of the daily working time and breaks are based on the respective specifications of the Employer.

(3) Upon request, you may also be required to work overtime and additional hours, as well as weekend, Sunday and public holiday work within the legally permissible scope.

(4) Your place of work is ***CITY***. You are obligated to offer the work at the agreed location.

## § 4 Leave
(1) You are entitled to 30 working days of leave per calendar year. Working days are all days that are neither Saturdays nor Sundays nor public holidays at the place of work.

(2) We will try to accommodate your leave requests as far as possible, but we must also take operational concerns into account. For our leave planning, it is necessary that you inform us of your leave wishes in good time.

(3) We are required by law to ask you to take your leave during the current calendar year. If you are unable to take all your leave in the current calendar year for urgent operational or personal reasons, your leave entitlement will be retained until March 31 of the following year. Your leave entitlement expires at the end of the calendar year or on March 31 of the following year if you do not comply with the request to go on leave, although you have been enabled to actually take the holiday leave.

## § 5 Inability to work
(1) You must notify the Employer of any inability to work and its expected duration by telephone or email immediately upon becoming aware of it, prior to the time you expect to begin work. The reasons for the inability to work must be communicated, insofar as this can be required of the Employer under data protection law.

(2) If you are not able to do this yourself, you must arrange for the Employer to be informed in the same way by a third party.

(3) Before the end of the third day of inability to work, you must submit a medical certificate of inability to work. This should also indicate the expected duration of the inability to work. If the inability to work lasts longer than the specified time, you must inform the Employer immediately and submit a follow-up medical certificate without delay. The Employer may also request earlier submission of the certificate in individual cases. The Employer is entitled to shorten the deadline to the first day of inability to work.

(4) You may also be entitled to time off from work if your child, who is disabled or under the age of 12, falls ill and needs to be supervised, attended or cared for by you. In this case, you must provide us with a corresponding medical certificate. If you are no longer entitled to continued payment of wages in this case, you are generally entitled to child sickness benefit, which must be applied for from the health insurance fund (Section 45 of the German Social Security Code, Book V).

## § 6 Secondary employment
(1) You undertake to only take up another paid or unpaid activity/employment with the prior consent of the Employer.

(2) Consent may only be refused if the commencement of the secondary employment would impair operational interests.

## § 7 Work results and transfer of rights
(1) **Work results**  
Work results are all results which you develop, create or acquire according to the corresponding instructions of the Employer, and/or which were and/or are necessary or conducive to the fulfilment of your employment contract tasks. If you have developed, created or acquired a result during working hours, it is presumed to be a work result. Work results are, in particular, software, databases, source codes, documentation, procedures, concepts, designs, sketches, drafts, preliminary studies, ideas, know-how, presentations, manuscripts, information sheets, reports, patents, instructions, pictures, photos, photo negatives, films, advertising and marketing material, trademarks, logos, word creations, construction or building plans and circuit diagrams.

(2) **Rights of the Employer**  
Work results under paragraph (1) are due to the Employer if one or more of the following conditions are met:  
a: The work product was developed in connection with a past, present or upcoming product or project.  
b: The work product was developed to be used by the Employer or the Employer's client.  
c: Other work results of the Employer were used to achieve the work result.  
d: The work result was created under the Employer's instruction or in connection with the work for the Employer according to instructions.

(3) **Assignment of the rights for open-source projects**  
The Employer shall assign to the Employee the entitlement to the results of the work referred to in paragraph (1), unless paragraph (2) is fulfilled, and the result is made available for public inspection and use under a free licence.
This applies regardless of which work equipment is used to achieve the work result, including work equipment provided by the Employer.
If there is any uncertainty as to whether this paragraph applies, please consult your supervisor.

(4) **Transfer of rights to the Employer**  
You irrevocably transfer to the Employer all rights of use and exploitation of all work results in accordance with paragraphs 1,2 and 3, exclusively, without limitation as to time, content and territory, including the unrestricted, consent-free right to modify and alter the work results as well as the right to reproduce, pass on and otherwise exploit the right of use, and grant in favour of the Employer its corresponding consent in accordance with § 34 and § 35 UrhG (German Copyright Act).

The transfer of rights refers to all rights of use and exploitation for all known and unknown types of use.

No further consent from you is required for the full or partial exercise of the rights under this provision. The rights of the Employee according to § 31a UrhG remain unaffected. The Employer shall not be obliged to register or exploit the rights of use.

If work results that were created before you were hired are incorporated into the Employer's work results, they remain your work results. By incorporating such work results into the Employer's work results, you grant the Employer an irrevocable, fully compensated, fully comprehensive right of use and exploitation.

(5) **Transfer of rights to third parties**  
The Employer shall be entitled, without obtaining further consent from you, to transfer all rights to which it is entitled under paragraph (4), in whole or in part, to third parties or to allow such third parties to exercise them.

(6) **Settlement**  
The transfer to the Employer of the rights to the work results in accordance with paragraphs 1,2 and 3 of the Employee's employment contract, as regulated in this clause, shall be compensated by the Employee's remuneration under the employment contract. This remuneration also includes successes in use and any exploitation proceeds from sales and/or licensing agreements with third parties. This applies regardless of whether a work result was created within or outside the activity. The regulations in §§ 32, 32a and 32c UrhG remain unaffected. You also waive your right to acknowledgement of authorship (§ 13 UrhG).

(7) **Contract termination**  
In the event of termination of the contract, the work results shall remain in the hands of the Employer, irrespective of the circumstances of termination, for further use and exploitation for an indefinite period of time, exclusively and without any restriction in terms of content. A right of access and/or surrender regarding such work results in favour of the Employee is expressly excluded. The Employee shall not be entitled to access and/or surrender of an author's copy.

## § 8 Confidentiality
(1) You are obligated to keep all operational information strictly confidential. This information includes all business, operational and technical information and documents, including those of our business partners.

(2) Of course, you are also obligated to observe the legal provisions on the protection of personal data and to conduct yourself accordingly. You will be obligated to comply with the relevant data protection regulations by means of a special written declaration upon commencement of the activity in accordance with the statutory regulation in Section 53 of the Federal Data Protection Act.

(3) Data confidentiality continues to exist even after termination of the employment relationship.

## § 9 Consent to the use, processing and storage of personal data
(1) By signing this contract you agree to the storage and further processing of your personal data as far as this will become necessary in the context of our business operations (§ 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO).

(3) In the event of prolonged absence from the company, after termination of the employment relationship or leave of absence, the items referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 must be returned to the Employer immediately.

(4) The same obligation to store and surrender applies to all documents and objects concerning the affairs of the business partners of the limited liability company that are in your possession.

(5) There is no right of retention in respect of the aforementioned documents.

## § 11 Gifts and benefits 
(1) You may not accept gifts or benefits of any kind from suppliers, customers or other business partners.

(2) If anyone attempts to provide you with any of the above services or otherwise influence your decision, you must notify us immediately and without being asked to do so.

## § 12 Termination
(1) After the end of the trial period, a notice period of three months to the end of a calendar month applies for ordinary termination, both for you and for us. If the notice periods are extended for the company in accordance with Section 622 (2) of the German Civil Code (BGB) as a result of length of service, they are also extended to the same extent for the Employee.

(2) The right to extraordinary termination without notice for good cause in accordance with Section 626 of the German Civil Code (BGB) remains unaffected by this.

(3) Pursuant to §623 of the German Civil Code (BGB), notice of termination must always be given in writing.

(4) We will observe special termination protection regulations.

## § 13 Other employment contract completion
(1) The employment relationship ends by cancellation agreement.

(2) The employment relationship ends, without the need for notice of termination, at the end of the month in which the Employee has fulfilled the requirements for drawing a full old-age pension from the statutory pension insurance scheme.

(3) The employment relationship shall also end, without notice of termination being required, at the end of the month in which the Employee receives a notice from a pension insurance institution regarding the granting of an unlimited pension due to complete reduction in earning capacity and any further employment of the Employee - even under changed working conditions - is excluded or unreasonable. In this case, the employment relationship shall end at the earliest two weeks after receipt of the written notification of the Employee about the termination due to the granting of the pension and the lack of the possibility of further employment.

## § 14 Special post-contractual rights and obligations
(1) You will train an employee as your successor within the framework of your contractual work obligations. Particular costs arising from this will be reimbursed according to agreement and individual proof.


(2) Insofar as you are in possession of source codes, licence keys or access data for a programme or licences provided for use, you shall surrender these in good time before termination of the employment relationship to the company.

(3) We, as the Employer, undertake for the period after termination of the employment relationship to include your name in all copies of the programme and the accompanying material used within the framework of the contractual use and/or not to remove them. This shall also apply in the event that the Company grants authorized use to third parties.

## § 15 Exclusion clause
(1) You must assert all your claims arising from the employment relationship in writing or in text form within 3 months of the due date. Otherwise your claim will expire.

(2) The time period shall commence as soon as the claim has arisen and you have become aware of the circumstances giving rise to the claim or should have become aware without incurring unreasonable effort. The same applies to us if we assert claims against you.

(3) The agreed exclusion period shall not include claims that have arisen as a result of intentional, criminal or unlawful acts or claims due to injury to life, limb or health, as well as claims that are not subject to exclusion periods due to statutory regulations.

## § 16 Consequences of the ineffectiveness of individual contractual provisions
(1) Should individual provisions of this contract be or become invalid in whole or in part, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions.

(2) The ineffective or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by the effective and enforceable provision whose effects come closest to the legal and economic objective pursued by the contracting parties with the ineffective or unenforceable provision.

# Employment Contract

[![Developed at Spaceteams](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spaceteams/badges/main/developed-at-spaceteams.svg)](https://spaceteams.de)

This is the contract that we are currently using at Spaceteams in [German](contract-de.md) and [English](contract-en.md).

We strive for a fair and transparent work environment.
To encourage other software companies to do the same, we provide this template for your own usage.

The document is written in markdown, since it’s easy to read, use and edit on GitHub.
In the spirit of open source, you are encouraged to adjust the contract to fit your specific needs.

We worked together with labour lawyers and data protection specialists extensively to make sure
that every clause is as reasonable and within the current german laws as possible.

Disclaimer: This template is provided “as is”, without any warranty of any kind.
Check with a lawyer, if you want to use the contract as is or adjust it for your own needs.

## Focus on open source [§ 7 (3)](contract-en.md#-7-work-results-and-transfer-of-rights)

Naturally, we use several tools and libraries that the open source community is developing.  
So we encourage our employees to be active in that community as well even during working hours.
And our employees keep ownership of their open-sourced code.

With this we want to give back to the community that helps us with our work.
